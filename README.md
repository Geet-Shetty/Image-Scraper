# Image-Scraper

Basic Image Web Scraper written in Java using the Jsoup Library. The program requires a link and a file directory as input, and
then writes all images in the given page to the file. As a general image scraper it works on most sites, but there are sites that save their 
images in different ways so the scraper doesn't pick them up. Also Jsoup has certain parsing limitiations that make it not the best 
library to use for scraping. The UI was made using Java Swing.
